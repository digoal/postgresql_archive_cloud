When we have many and many PostgreSQL Databases, these database's wal archive management will much complex. 

We must has a simple manage tool to do it.

2. analyze the archive history information, 

3. find which database will use more and which database use few storage to record the wal files. 

4. this tool can manage these infomation and use storages properly.

5. use IDC's disperse storage within many other Servers.

Yes, these feature like cloud, so named the tool postgresql_archive_colud.
